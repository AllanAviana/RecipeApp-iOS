# RecipeApp

**RecipeApp** is a simple app I built to explore and discover recipes by country. It uses **TheMealDB API** and organizes meals into categories like American, Italian, Mexican, Japanese, and Chinese. You can browse the lists and open a details screen to see ingredients and instructions.

Itâ€™s basically a small project to make it easier to find something tasty without overcomplicating things.

## Features

- **Welcome View:**  
  A friendly intro with a start button and quick hints about the app.

- **Home View:**  
  Shows several country sections (American, Italian, Mexican, Japanese, Chinese), each listing recipes with images and titles.

- **Details View:**  
  Displays the selected recipe image, title, instructions and a bullet list of ingredients.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift**: Implemented for handling the core logic and managing game functionality.
- **SwiftUI**: Utilized to design the app's user interface with a declarative approach.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Ensures a clear separation between the UI (View) and business logic (ViewModel).
- **TheMealDB API**: Provides a comprehensive database of recipes and meal details.
- **Xcode**: The primary IDE used for development and testing the application.
