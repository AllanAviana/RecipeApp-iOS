# RecipeApp-iOS

**RecipeApp** is a personal project I created to make cooking more accessible and fun. The app features a WelcomeScreen, HomeScreen, and DetailsScreen, each designed with a clean and engaging interface. Using the TheMealDB API, RecipeApp offers a variety of recipes from different cuisines, complete with detailed instructions and ingredient lists. The app is perfect for anyone looking to discover new dishes or improve their cooking skills. Whether you're exploring American pancakes or Italian pasta, RecipeApp makes it easy to find and follow delicious recipes.
